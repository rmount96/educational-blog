# Python 101
    1. Variables
    2. Numbers
    3. Strings

## Variables
    - A variable is defined by a value
    - Use '=' to assign a value to the variable
- example: greeting = "Hello World"
    1. 'greeting' is our variable
    2. 'Hello World' is the value assigned to 'greeting'

## Numbers
    1. Can be assigned to a variable
    2. Can be an integer (whole numbers)
    3. Can also be a float (numbers with decimals)
    4. We are able to changed the assigned numbers by decrementing (decreasing) and by incrementing (increasing) the value
example: 
- int_num = 1
- increment = 5
- int_num += increment
    - This tells the computer 1 = 1 + 5
    - This will change int_num
