## I've been taking the tools that we learned on day two to make a simple program that would tell football announcers a player's name by typing their number

1. The idea is for them to not have to look through a list of names to find the right one 
2. It saves the announcer time
3. Decreases the room for error when calling out player names after a big play

### I am assigning each player number to the associated player name on the Saints roster
